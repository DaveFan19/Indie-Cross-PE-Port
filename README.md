# BEFORE YOU CONTINUE READING, PLEASE READ THIS FIRST

This port is making me _sick_ because of the mechanics and songs i have to add, and also, this is **NOT** easy, there's already another indie cross port avaiable but, you know right? I'm not gonna just steal the code from there.

Currently, **help is needed with the port**, so if you want to help us, you can by creating a pull request or a discussion!

**_AND ALSO, THIS WAS A DISCUSSION ON PSYCHDISCUSSIONS BUT MAYO78 DECIDED TO CLOSE THE DISCUSSION._**

_As of now, the discussion is on hold and most likely never gonna be open again. (Well, maybe because there's an advertisement category now)_

Thanks.

# Another psych engine port, this time with a really epic mod.

# What does this port contain? (Beta 1)

This mod contains content from Indie Cross, but there are only 3 songs from Cuphead's week avaiable, if you wish to play them even if they are not finished, download the port.

Also, the perry note it's as of now work in progress since the note doesn't do anything yet.
